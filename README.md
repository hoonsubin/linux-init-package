# linux-init-package
A shell script that installs a set of developer tools for a new linux box.
Currently it's optimized for Debian/Ubuntu and Kali-linux.

## How to install

1. clone this repository and open a terminal inside the folder
2. `$ chmod +x init-install.sh`
3. `$ ./init-install.sh` (do not use `sudo` in this script, VS code doesn't like that)
